# River Status

[status.ckp.fyi](https://status.ckp.fyi)

This is a small remix app that gathers and presents some different river related data sources in one place.
It is configured to collect from data sets that were useful for my purposes.

It uses:
* Flow data from the Environment Agency API
* Storm discharge data from Thames Water API
* Tide Times data from the Admirality API
